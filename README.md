# TT Workspace and Bitcoin Tracker

This project is a fully responsive web application for workspace and Bitcoin management.

It features a "Workspace" page where users can freely adjust the size and position of improvised blocks, allowing for flexible organization. The site also includes a real-time Bitcoin transaction tracker: users can view live transaction data, pause the transaction stream, or clear the transaction list at any time.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **React**: UI library for building interactive interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for safer and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **lucide-react**: Icon library for React.
- **react-rnd**: I used it to add drag and resize functionality for Blocks in Workspace.
- **zustand**: Lightweight state management for React. I stored there my Blocks(with persist to save blocks position on reload) and Tracker logic.
- **ESLint**: Code linting and quality.

## Project Purpose

- **Frontend (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)**: Delivers a responsive and maintainable user interface.
- **State Management (zustand)**: Efficient and simple state handling.
- **UI Enhancements (lucide-react, react-rnd, Radix UI)**: Rich UI components and interactions.
- **Code Quality (ESLint)**: Enforces code standards and reliability.
